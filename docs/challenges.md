# OML-Copilot: Challenges and Solutions

This document outlines the key challenges encountered during the development of OML-Copilot and the innovative solutions implemented to address them.

## Limited Training Data

### Challenge
Unlike popular programming languages with millions of examples, OML has a relatively small corpus of available code examples.

### Solution
- **Quality over Quantity**: Focused on carefully curating 301 high-quality examples from the openCAESAR repositories and UA stack
- **Example Decomposition**: Broke down larger vocabularies into smaller, focused snippets to multiply available examples
- **Structured Annotation**: Added detailed metadata to examples, enabling more precise retrieval
- **RAG Optimization**: Implemented advanced semantic search techniques to maximize utility of limited examples

## Grammar Complexity and Validation

### Challenge
OML's formal grammar is complex, with intricate rules that are difficult to implement in validation systems and explain to users.

### Solution
- **Grammar Translation**: Manually converted EBNF grammar to Lark format for efficient parsing
- **Hierarchical Validation**: Implemented multi-level validation from basic syntax to semantic correctness
- **Targeted Error Messages**: Developed specific error detection that identifies exact issue locations
- **Example-Based Correction**: When errors are detected, system retrieves examples of correct usage
- **Iterative Feedback Loop**: Created an agentic approach for progressive code improvement

## Vocabulary Dependencies

### Challenge
OML vocabularies often depend on other vocabularies, creating a complex web of dependencies that must be managed correctly.

### Solution
- **Workspace Analysis**: Automatically scans user workspace to identify available vocabularies
- **Dependency Extraction**: Analyzes build files to identify vocabulary dependencies
- **Intelligent Defaults**: Automatically includes standard core vocabularies (owl, rdfs, dc, etc.)
- **Missing Dependency Handling**: Proactively alerts users to missing dependencies before generation
- **Extension Restriction**: Constrains code generation to only use available vocabularies

## Balancing Explanation and Generation

### Challenge
Early experiments often produced explanatory text rather than actual OML code, especially with zero-shot prompting.

### Solution
- **Structured Output Format**: Implemented JSON output parsing to enforce code generation
- **Two-Stage Generation**: Separated explanation and code generation phases
- **Explicit Instructions**: Enhanced system prompts with clear formatting requirements
- **Post-Processing**: Added code extraction to isolate OML from surrounding text
- **Temperature Control**: Adjusted LLM randomness parameters to focus on deterministic code generation

## Handling Complex Errors

### Challenge
Error messages from the grammar parser were often cryptic and difficult for the LLM to interpret and address.

### Solution
- **Error Translation**: Converted technical parser errors into natural language explanations
- **Common Error Patterns**: Identified recurring error types and created specific handling strategies
- **Exemplar Insertion**: Automatically retrieved examples of correct pattern usage for problematic constructs
- **Progressive Refinement**: Implemented multi-step debugging where each step addresses specific issues
- **Context Preservation**: Maintained full conversation context through regeneration cycles

## Embedding and Similarity Challenges

### Challenge
Early RAG implementations struggled to find truly relevant examples, often returning superficially similar but structurally different code.

### Solution
- **Dual Embedding Approach**: Implemented separate embeddings for query text and code structure
- **CodeBERT Integration**: Used code-specific embedding model to capture programming patterns
- **Multi-stage Retrieval**: First retrieving by semantic similarity, then by structural similarity
- **Token Management**: Implemented tiktoken to optimize context window usage
- **Hierarchy of Relevance**: Prioritized examples matching both domain and structure

## VS Code Integration Complexity

### Challenge
Integrating the complete pipeline into VS Code while maintaining performance and usability proved challenging.

### Solution
- **Extension Evaluation**: Thoroughly evaluated existing extensions (Continue, CodeGPT, Tabby)
- **Continue Selection**: Chose Continue for its customizability and RAG support
- **Local Model Support**: Ensured compatibility with locally hosted LLMs
- **Context Management**: Optimized how workspace context is captured and utilized
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Implemented non-blocking operations for validation and regeneration

## Performance Constraints

### Challenge
Running large language models with extensive context windows posed performance challenges, especially for rapid iteration.

### Solution
- **Model Selection**: Chose Mistral 7B as optimal balance between capability and efficiency
- **Quantization**: Implemented model quantization to reduce memory footprint
- **Context Pruning**: Developed intelligent context selection to maximize relevance while minimizing size
- **Parallel Processing**: Implemented concurrent operations where possible
- **Caching**: Added result caching for common patterns and validations
- **Optimized Embeddings**: Selected efficient embedding models that maintain quality with lower computational cost

## Addressing Hallucinations

### Challenge
LLMs occasionally generated plausible-looking but invalid OML constructs or non-existent extensions.

### Solution
- **Grammar Constraints**: Implemented strict grammar validation to catch invalid constructs
- **Vocabulary Restriction**: Explicitly limited available vocabularies in generation prompts
- **Example Grounding**: Heavily weighted generation toward relevant examples
- **Post-Generation Validation**: Added multiple validation layers before presenting results
- **User Confirmation**: Implemented explicit acknowledgment for vocabulary usage
